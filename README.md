# gelasia-compacter
The gelasia-compacter is an utility (wrote on C) to pack and unpack series of integer numbers on a sequence of bytes, usually to be sended or stored on a compressed way. This is done using the, here first time described, "gelasia number representation" that ensures the smaller numbers to use less bits.

src/test.c has example code of how the utility should be used.
