# gelasia-compacter
The gelasia-compacter is a utility (wrote on C) to pack and unpack series of integer numbers in a sequence of bytes, usually to be sent or stored in a compressed format. This is done using the, here first time described, "gelasia number representation" that ensures the smaller numbers to use less bits.

src/test.c has example code of how the utility should be used.
